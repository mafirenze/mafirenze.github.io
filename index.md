I am a first-year EECS PhD student at MIT. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Polina Golland](https://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/). In my undergrad, I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Christine Hendon](https://structurefunctionlab.ee.columbia.edu/) at Columbia Engineering. My current research is in developing computer vision methods for fetal imaging.

For anyone interested in applying to graduate school, here is my [advice](./grad_advice.md).
