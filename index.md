I am a first-year EECS PhD student at MIT. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Polina Golland](https://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/). I'm interested on developing computer vision tools with applications to medical imaging clinical use. My current research focus is on slice-to-volume reconstruction for fetal MRI brain imaging. 

Previously, I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Christine Hendon](https://structurefunctionlab.ee.columbia.edu/) at Columbia Engineering. 

For anyone interested in applying to graduate school, here is my [advice](./grad_advice.md).
